I highly recommend listening to Light of the Seven in the background.
Niceland I came up with the name inside the car, when everyone was looking through the windows and constantly someone was saying &amp;ldquo;nice&amp;rdquo;. It is a nice land indeed, but only saying it is nice is an understatement.</description></item><item><title>Docker deep dive</title><link>https://antooni.github.io/developer-note/docker-deep-dive/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://antooni.github.io/developer-note/docker-deep-dive/</guid><description>Motivation There are two main reasons for writing this article:

Try logging in text mode Switch to text mode (Ctrl+Alt+F5) and try to login, if you are able to do it then the problem is with your graphical login manager.
2. Remove configuration files To determine whether configuration in your home directory is causing the issue, you can create a new user account for testing purposes:
sudo adduser test sudo systemctl reboot If you&amp;rsquo;re able to log in with the test user, the issue is somewhere in your regular user&amp;rsquo;s home folder.</description></item><item><title>Encrypted DNS</title><link>https://antooni.github.io/developer-note/encrypt-dns/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://antooni.github.io/developer-note/encrypt-dns/</guid><description>Encrypt DNS traffic Recently, I have been setting up VPN connection and during network sniffing with Wireshark I found out that all my DNS request are plain text, so there is a room to potentially see all my DNS request.

认识 认识 (rèn shi) is most commonly used to imply familiarity with another person, place or object through a previous experience.
知道 知道 (zhī dao) suggests knowledge of a person, place or object, but has never been introduced to the person or been to the place physically.</description></item><item><title>🇳🇴 Bergen</title><link>https://antooni.github.io/travel/bergen/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://antooni.github.io/travel/bergen/</guid><description>The fjord cruise dream I wanted to have unforgettable summer trip with my girlfriend. During last year I was saving money for that, but the catch is, I did not know the destination.
