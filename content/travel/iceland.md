# Place like no other

Let's embark together on a trip over Iceland, during which I will introduce my thoughts and memories from the **Land of Ice and Fire**.

I highly recommend listening to [Light of the Seven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJHPlKPOc78) in the background.

## Niceland

I came up with the name inside the car, when everyone was looking through the windows and constantly someone was saying "nice". It is a nice land indeed, but only saying it is nice is an understatement. But to be honest, it is hard to put into words what one sees there. Maybe "nice" is not that bad of a word after all, because it leaves the place for interpretation. I will try to fill this void with photos and hopefully will manage to familiarize you with the truly remarkable world of this small distant island.

## Variety of scapes

Something that amazed me and kept doing it through out the journey was how many different views there are to see. Less than one hour is how long it takes to travel to the other world on Iceland.

It really felt as if we visited multiple countries and climatic zones. I was used to more monolithic nature, e.g. when being in the mountains area one expects mountains-like views and nothing other. But not here...

**All the photos were taken in the span of a week and in the area three times smaller than Poland, but for me they do look like from different seasons and different continents.**

## Power of nature
